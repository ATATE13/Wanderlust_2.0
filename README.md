## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project
This project is a virtual vacation application that incorporates several API calls and features. We are using two forms of persistent data with Firebase and local storage. Firebase is storing the user name and email. Local storage is also storing the user name to personalize the page. In addition, the input box allows the user to select the country to explore. After a user submits the form, the app retrieves this information with multiple APIs. Rest countries API pulls the country input selected and provides information such as language, currency and capital city. Once this call completes the capital city information is then applied to both the Open Weather Map API and Google Maps API to display current weather and map of the location. Other fun features include travel links to make your dream a reality. Some other fun features are URL links to sky scanner to look up flight information. Also, included are reviews from customers.

<li>User completes input fields name, email and country of choice.</li> 
<li>Information is submitted to Firebase storage once submit button is clicked.</li> 
<li>Using AJAX calls to the RESTcountries API the country information is pulled for language, currency and capital city.</li>
<li>From the results of the RESTcountries API capital city calls the open weather map API to pull the current weather and Google map to pull location.</li>

Because Firebase is a Google product, you will need to use your Google account to access and log into Firebase. If you don't have a Google account, you will need to create one.

## <a name="OpenWeatherMapAPI"></a> How to use OpenWeatherMap API
Website: https://openweathermap.org/
<li>Sign up and get an API key (APPID) on your account page. It takes up to 1 hour to activate your API key. We send you a confirmation email as your API key is ready to work.</li>
<li>Start using API for free. Find the complete description of API calls with a list of parameters and examples of responses in API documentation.</li>
<li>Please, use API key in each API call.If you need more features than Free account can give you, look at the options of our monthly subscriptions here. Choose your subscription depending on a number of calls per sec, API availability, service provided, and other features.</li>

## <a name="restcountriesapi"></a> How to use REST Countries API
Website: https://restcountries.eu/
<p>REST Countries provides a simple API for getting information about the world's nations via REST calls. These calls allow users to retrieve all available countries or to retrieve a given country's currency, capital city, calling code, region, sub-region, ISO 639-1 language, name, or country code.</p>

<li>From the  Navigation menu, select APIs & Services > Credentials.</li>
<li>On the Credentials page, click Create credentials > API key.</li> 
    <ul>The API key created dialog displays your newly created API key.</ul>
<li>On the dialog, click Restrict Key.</li> 
    <ul>(For more information, see Restricting an API key.)</ul>
<li>On the API key page, under Key restrictions, set the Application restrictions.</li>

<li>Fill input information, "name", "email" and select a country.</li>
<li>Click "submit" button to make API calls.</li>
<li>The Rest Countries API pulls information about a country such as language, currency and capital city.</li>
<li>Once the Rest Countries API completes its call the OpenWeatherApp API using the capital city to give the current weather.</li>
<li>Then pulls the Google Maps API uses capital city to give map location.</li>

## <a name="form-input-validation"></a> Form input validation
<li>The app uses form input validation for the user information to check or validate the following:</li>

<ul>The user has entered a value for every field (that is, all fields are required.).</ul>
<ul>This ensures that there are no empty or null values when the form is submitted.</ul> 
<ul>If the user tries to add information when there is an empty or null value.</ul>
<ul>The user enters name, email and selects country.</ul>
<ul>User information is sent to Firebase for storage.</ul>

## <a name="future-enhancements"></a> Future enhancements
<li>Email to stay in contact with users, based on user input information.</li>
<li>Add language development based on the country.</li>
<li>Add selection for users to leave a personal review</li>
